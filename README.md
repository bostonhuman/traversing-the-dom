# Traversing the DOM

When you have made a jQuery selection, you can use these methods to access other element nodes relative to the initial selection. When the page loads, the list is hidden, and a link is added to the heading that indicates the users can display the list if they wish. The link is added inside the heading and, if the user clicks anywhere on the `<h2>` element, the `<ul>` element is faded in.
